	USAGE: assoc2qqman.py <prefix.assoc.txt>
    Read the output of gemma 'prefix.assoc.txt' derived 
    from the association analysis command and performs 
    readjustment of the file to be compatible for Read
    R analysis with the package 'qqman'. Note that chromosomes
    should either be named as digits or digits with prefix "Chr"
    as e.g Chr3. All other nomenclatures will be removed from the
    output file.
    Compatible Python27 and Python37
